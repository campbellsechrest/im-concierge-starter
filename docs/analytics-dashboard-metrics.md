# Analytics Dashboard Metrics Specification

*For UX/UI Designer - IM Concierge Analytics Dashboard*

## Overview

This document provides a structured specification of all available metrics from the IM Concierge analytics system. The data is organized into logical dashboard sections with clear explanations of what each metric means and how it should be visualized.

**Core Purpose**: Track performance of the layered intent router system and show how queries are being handled at each routing layer.
