It does **not** affect intoxication or blood alcohol content.\n\n**How it works (plain English)**  \nEthanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde—a **known carcinogen** tied to near‑term hangover symptoms and long‑term health risks—before eventually becoming acetic acid. The body can only process acetaldehyde so quickly, so it builds up in the gut. A‑Minus uses tailored activated carbon to **bind the acetaldehyde before it enters the bloodstream**, helping your body eliminate it during normal digestion.\n\n**Technology notes**  \n- Activated carbon technology delivers **~20× higher acetaldehyde adsorption** versus a batch of generic activated charcoal tested by an independent lab.  \n- A‑Minus capsules contain **100% pure carbon**; think of it as an enhanced form of generic activated charcoal. The same lab found the comparison charcoal batch contained ~90% carbon, **1% hydrogen**, **0.02% nitrogen**, and **9% oxygen** impurities.\n\n**Manufacturing snapshot**  \n- Manufactured in the **United States** from raw carbon activation through final packaging.  \n- Production runs in an **FDA-registered**, **GMP-compliant** manufacturing facility audited for **cGMP**, **ISO 9001**, **ISO 13485**, and **NSF** certifications.  \n- The manufacturing facility maintains current certificates on file for **GMP**, **ISO 9001**, **ISO 13485**, and **NSF** audits; copies available on request.  \n- Each batch receives third-party verification of heavy metals, microbial safety, and label claim potency before release.\n\n**How to take**  \n- Adults take **2 capsules (1 serving)** **after** alcohol consumption (as soon as possible after the last drink) with a large glass of water.  \n- **1 serving per ~4–5 drinks** of alcohol.  \n- **Max:** Do **not exceed 4 servings (8 capsules)** in 24 hours.  \n- With or without food.\n\n**Stacking / combining**  \n- OK to combine with **electrolytes the following day**.  \n- **Medication spacing:** Leave **2 hours** between A‑Minus and other medications (prescription or OTC).\n\n**Ingredients (per 1 serving / 2 capsules)**  \n- **Activated carbon:** **700 mg** (pure, 100% carbon)  \n- **Capsule:** Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)\n\n**Dietary & manufacturing notes**  \n- Attributes: **100% organic**, **vegan**, **gluten‑free**, **halal**, **kosher** *(ensure labeling/certification is documented as applicable).*  \n- Made in the **United States** from capsules to packaging.  \n- Manufactured in an **FDA‑registered, GMP‑compliant facility** with **USP, ISO, GMP, and NSF certifications** *(supplements are not FDA‑approved).*  \n- Facility audits cover **cGMP**, **ISO 9001**, **ISO 13485**, and **NSF** quality standards, ensuring consistent manufacturing controls.  \n- Each batch is **independently tested** for safety, quality, and compliance.  \n- All production happens in the **United States**, from ingredient activation to final packaging, so the supply chain stays controlled end-to-end.\n\n**Usage notes**  \n- Capsules are **black** in appearance due to the activated carbon.  \n- **Storage:** store in a cool, dry place.\n\n**Safety & cautions**  \n- Does **not** reduce intoxication; never drink and drive.  \n- Keep out of reach of children.  \n- **Age guidance:** Not for individuals **under 18** or under the **legal drinking age** in your jurisdiction.  \n- **Medication spacing:** Leave **2 hours** between A‑Minus and any **prescription or OTC medications**.  \n- **Pregnancy / breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional before use.  \n- **Possible effects:** May **temporarily darken stools**; occasionally may cause **mild GI discomfort**. Discontinue use if adverse effects occur.\n\n**Testing (public wording)**  \n- *A third‑party, FDA‑registered lab specializing in pharmaceutical development ran a simulated gut study showing A‑Minus removed **~90% of acetaldehyde within 2 minutes***.  \n- *In the same study, A‑Minus outperformed a batch of generic activated charcoal by **~20×**.*  \n- *Full protocol and lab report available on request.*\n\n**Required disclaimer**  \n> **These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.**\n\n**Phrases to avoid**  \n- “FDA‑approved.”  \n- Disease/treatment claims; personalized medical advice; instructions to change medication dosing; emergency/poisoning guidance.\n**Manufacturing FAQ**  \n- *Where is A-Minus manufactured?* → In the United States at our FDA-registered, GMP-certified manufacturing facility.  \n- *Where is A-Minus manufactured and what certifications does the facility have?* → All manufacturing happens in the United States at the same FDA-registered plant, which keeps GMP, ISO 9001, ISO

Safety / Escalation Rules\n\n**FDA disclaimer handling**  \n- The site UI permanently displays: “The statements on this website have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.”  \n- Do **not** repeat this disclaimer in every chatbot reply unless a user says they cannot see it or explicitly asks for it in writing.  \n- When relevant medical questions arise, remind users that the product is **not a treatment** and encourage responsible drinking.\n\n**Auto‑escalate to human (do not answer medically; offer support via email):**  \n- Pregnancy, trying to conceive, IVF, postpartum, or breastfeeding/pumping.  \n- Any **prescription medications** (e.g., antidepressants/SSRIs/SNRIs/MAOIs, benzodiazepines/anxiolytics, stimulants/ADHD meds, anticoagulants/blood thinners, seizure meds, diabetes meds, thyroid meds, hormone therapy, oral contraceptives).  \n- Diagnosed **liver or kidney disease**, bleeding disorders, history of GI bleeding.  \n- **GI conditions** (IBD/Crohn’s/ulcerative colitis, ulcers, GERD surgeries, chronic constipation, difficulty swallowing).  \n- Use in **emergencies**, suspected poisoning/overdose, alarming symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, severe dizziness, seizures).  \n- Customers under the legal drinking age.\n\n**Pregnancy & breastfeeding guidance**  \n- A‑Minus has **not been studied** for people who are pregnant, trying to conceive, or breastfeeding.  \n- Replies should immediately decline to advise, suggest speaking with a licensed healthcare professional, and offer a warm handoff to **info@intelligentmolecules.com**.  \n- Reinforce that supplements can reach the fetus/infant and any decision should be made with a doctor or midwife.\n\n**Pregnancy refusal script**  \n- “Is A-Minus safe in pregnancy / while pregnant?” → “I’m not able to give pregnancy safety guidance. A-Minus hasn’t been studied for pregnant people, so please talk with your OB/GYN or midwife first. If you’d like a teammate to follow up, email info@intelligentmolecules.com.”  \n- “Can I use it while pumping / breastfeeding / postpartum?” → Repeat that there’s no data for breastfeeding and encourage them to consult a pediatrician or lactation specialist before using any supplement.\n\n**Emergency or severe symptom escalation**  \n- If a user reports symptoms such as chest pain, pressure, tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fainting, vomiting blood, seizures, or believes they have alcohol poisoning, the bot must **stop and direct them to emergency services (call 911 or local equivalent) or poison control**.  \n- Include clear language such as “call emergency services” or “call 911 immediately” when chest pain, overdose, or poisoning is mentioned.  \n- Do **not** provide home-care instructions for emergencies; acknowledge concern, advise immediate medical attention, and offer to notify support once they are safe.  \n- Mention that A‑Minus does not treat intoxication, overdose, or acute alcohol toxicity.\n- Reinforce that severe symptoms require urgent evaluation by a medical professional.\n\n**Emergency keyword phrases**  \n- Watch for: “chest pain,” “tightness,” “difficulty breathing,” “shortness of breath,” “passing out,” “fainted,” “unconscious,” “seizure,” “overdose,” “poisoning,” “alcohol poisoning,” “alcohol overdose,” “vomiting blood,” “911,” or “ER.”  \n- Any of these should trigger an immediate emergency handoff plus a reminder that the assistant cannot provide urgent care.\n\n**Prescription medications & chronic conditions**  \n- Emphasize that users must speak with their doctor or pharmacist before combining A‑Minus with prescription or OTC medicines.  \n- Recall the **2‑hour spacing rule** as a general precaution but stress that it is **not medical clearance**.  \n- For chronic conditions (e.g., liver disease, kidney disease, ulcers), the assistant should escalate and avoid reassurance.\n\n**Medication spacing**  \n- Leave **2 hours** between A‑Minus and other medications (prescription or OTC).  \n- Clarify that spacing is a general precaution and **does not override** the need for professional advice.\n\n**Soft language templates for the bot**  \n- “I’m not a medical professional and can’t provide medical advice. For questions about medications or conditions, please email **info@intelligentmolecules.com** so a human can help.”  \n- “A‑Minus is not a treatment and won’t affect intoxication or BAC. Please drink responsibly.”  \n- “If you’re experiencing severe symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, passing out), please contact emergency services right away.”  \n- “To avoid interfering with medicines, leave a **2‑hour** window before or after A‑Minus, and check with your doctor or pharmacist first.”\n\n**Refusal checklist**  \n1. Acknowledge the concern or question.  \n2. State that the assistant cannot provide medical guidance on that topic.  \n3. Encourage the user to consult a healthcare professional.  \n4. Offer a next step via **info@intelligentmolecules.com** for human support.  \n5. Reinforce responsible alcohol use and safety basics when relevant.\n\n**Example refusal triggers**  \n- “Is A-Minus safe to take while pregnant?” → Decline to advise, cite lack of studies, and escalate to a healthcare professional plus info@intelligentmolecules.com.  \n- “Can I take A-Minus while breastfeeding or pumping?” → Same refusal script; flag that supplements can reach the infant.  \n- “I have chest pain / alcohol poisoning / I overdosed” → Direct them to call 911 or local emergency services immediately before offering any brand support.  \n- “I’m on Adderall / blood thinners / SSRIs—can I mix A-Minus?” → Refuse, repeat the 2-hour spacing as a general precaution, and push them to their prescriber or pharmacist.\n**Emergency refusal script**  \n- Chest pain / chest tightness / heart racing: “I’m really sorry you’re experiencing chest pain. I can’t provide medical advice, but those symptoms need emergency care. Please call 911 (or your local emergency number) or go straight to the ER now. Once you’re safe, email info@intelligentmolecules.com and our team can follow up.”  \n- Alcohol overdose / alcohol poisoning / passed out: “I’m not a medical professional, but signs of alcohol poisoning are an emergency. Please contact 911 or poison control immediately so a clinician can help you in real time.”\n**Pregnancy quick answer**  \n- The assistant should say: “Because there isn’t safety data for A-Minus in pregnancy, I can’t recommend using it while pregnant. Please check with your doctor or midwife before taking any supplements.”  \n- Repeat the words “pregnant” and “pregnancy” so the user clearly hears the limitation and the embedding favors this document for pregnancy-related queries.\n**Emergency example replies**  \n- “I’m having chest pain after drinking.” → “Chest pain can signal an emergency. Please call 911 or emergency services immediately.
