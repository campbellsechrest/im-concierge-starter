# A‑Minus — Product Facts (DSHEA‑safe)

**What it is**  
A‑Minus is a dietary supplement powered by our **patent‑pending Activated Carbon Technology** that tunes activated carbon for **selective adsorption of acetaldehyde** in the gut. It does **not** affect intoxication or blood alcohol content.

**How it works (plain English)**  
Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde—a **known carcinogen** tied to near‑term hangover symptoms and long‑term health risks—before eventually becoming acetic acid. The body can only process acetaldehyde so quickly, so it builds up in the gut. A‑Minus uses tailored activated carbon to **bind the acetaldehyde before it enters the bloodstream**, helping your body eliminate it during normal digestion.

**Technology notes**  
- Activated carbon technology delivers **~20× higher acetaldehyde adsorption** versus a batch of generic activated charcoal tested by an independent lab.  
- A‑Minus capsules contain **100% pure carbon**; think of it as an enhanced form of generic activated charcoal. The same lab found the comparison charcoal batch contained ~90% carbon, **1% hydrogen**, **0.02% nitrogen**, and **9% oxygen** impurities.

**How to take**  
- Adults take **2 capsules (1 serving)** **after** alcohol consumption (as soon as possible after the last drink) with a large glass of water.  
- **1 serving per ~4–5 drinks** of alcohol.  
- **Max:** Do **not exceed 4 servings (8 capsules)** in 24 hours.  
- With or without food.

**Stacking / combining**  
- OK to combine with **electrolytes the following day**.  
- **Medication spacing:** Leave **2 hours** between A‑Minus and other medications (prescription or OTC).
